# OpenGL_Math_Game

I built this game using OpenGL/C++ for a university project.

- The game starts when the player selects the play button. A rectangle flows from the bottom of the screen to the top, <br />
each time with a different random mathematical equation.<br />
- The user types the answer and presses ENTER.<br />
- If the answer is correct, the score is incremented and the rectangle starts back at the bottom instead of continuing its way up the screen.<br />
- If the answer is incorrect, nothing happens.<br />
- The user only has 60 seconds to solve as many equations as possible.<br />

When time is over, so is the game. <br /> Your score is then displayed along with your rank.

If the player selects the Highscores button in the main menu, the game displays the top 5 scores.
